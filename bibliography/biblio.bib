  abstract = {Information systems can serve as intermediaries between the buyers
    and the sellers in a vertical market, thus creating an {"}electronic
    market-place.{"} A major impact of these electronic market systems
    is that they typically reduce the search costs buyers must pay to
    obtain information about the prices and product offerings available
    in the market. Economic theory suggests that this reduction in search
    costs plays a major role in determining the implications of these
    systems for market efficiency and competitive behavior. This article
    draws on economic models of search and examines how prices, seller
    profits, and buyer welfare are affected by reducing search costs
    in commodity and differentiated markets. This reduction results
    in direct efficiency gains from reduced intermediation costs and
    in indirect but possibly larger gains in allocational efficiency
    from better-informed buyers. Because electronic market systems generally
    reduce buyers' search costs, they ultimately increase the efficiency
    of interorganizational transactions, in the process affecting the
    market power of buyers and sellers. The economic characteristics
    of electronic marketplaces, in addition to their ability to reduce
    search costs, create numerous possibilities for the strategic use
    of these systems.},

  month = {November},
  abstract = {{Kent Beck's <I>eXtreme Programming eXplained</I> provides an intriguing
    high-level overview of the author's Extreme Programming (XP) software
    development methodology. Written for IS managers, project leaders,
    or programmers, this guide provides a glimpse at the principles
    behind XP and its potential advantages for small- to mid-size software
    development teams.<p> The book intends to describe what XP is, its
    guiding principles, and how it works. Simply written, the book avoids
    case studies and concrete details in demonstrating the efficacy
    of XP. Instead, it demonstrates how XP relies on simplicity, unit
    testing, programming in pairs, communal ownership of code, and customer
    input on software to motivate code improvement during the development
    process. As the author notes, these principles are not new, but
    when they're combined their synergy fosters a new and arguably better
    way to build and maintain software. Throughout the book, the author
    presents and explains these principles, such as "rapid feedback"
    and "play to win," which form the basis of XP.<p> Generally speaking,
    XP changes the way programmers work. The book is good at delineating
    new roles for programmers and managers who Beck calls "coaches."
    The most striking characteristic of XP is that programmers work
    in pairs, and that testing is an intrinsic part of the coding process.
    In a later section, the author even shows where XP works and where
    it doesn't and offers suggestions for migrating teams and organizations
    over to the XP process. <p> In the afterword, the author recounts
    the experiences that led him to develop and refine XP, an insightful
    section that should inspire any organization to adopt XP. This book
    serves as a useful introduction to the philosophy and practice of
    XP for the manager or programmer who wants a potentially better
    way to build software. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>:
    Extreme Programming (XP) software methodology, principles, XP team
    roles, facilities design, testing, refactoring, the XP software
    lifecycle, and adopting XP.} {Software development projects can
    be fun, productive, and even daring. Yet they can consistently deliver
    value to a business and remain under control. <P>Extreme Programming
    (XP) was conceived and developed to address the specific needs of
    software development conducted by small teams in the face of vague
    and changing requirements. This new lightweight methodology challenges
    many conventional tenets, including the long-held assumption that
    the cost of changing a piece of software necessarily rises dramatically
    over the course of time. XP recognizes that projects have to work
    to achieve this reduction in cost and exploit the savings once they
    have been earned. <P>Fundamentals of XP include: <P>* Distinguishing
    between the decisions to be made by business interests and those
    to be made by project stakeholders. * Writing unit tests before
    programming and keeping all of the tests running at all times. *
    Integrating and testing the whole system-several times a day. *
    Producing all software in pairs, two programmers at one screen.
    * Starting projects with a simple design that constantly evolves
    to add needed flexibility and remove unneeded complexity. * Putting
    a minimal system into production quickly and growing it in whatever
    directions prove most valuable. <P>Why is XP so controversial? Some
    sacred cows don't make the cut in XP: <P>* Don't force team members
    to specialize and become analysts, architects, programmers, testers,
    and integrators-every XP programmer participates in all of these
    critical activities every day. * Don't conduct complete up-front
    analysis and design-an XP project starts with a quick analysis of
    the entire system, and XP programmers continue to make analysis
    and design decisions throughout development. * Develop infrastructure
    and frameworks as you develop your application, not up-front-delivering
    business value is the heartbeat that drives XP projects. * Don't
    write and maintain implementation documentation-communication in
    XP projects occurs face-to-face, or through efficient tests and
    carefully written code. <P>You may love XP or you may hate it, but
    Extreme Programming Explained will force you to take a fresh look
    at how you develop software.}},

    most persuasive sales tools used in traditional retailng: a sales
    clerk who says hello and offers help. A recent Gartner case study
    for the e-tailer Land's End found that shoppers who use the site's
    live chat are 67 percent more likely to buy than non-chatters. The
    multitasking capability is why LoCascio hasn't pushed broadband
    applications like audio or video, though he expects the company
    to one day adopt them. "Those mediums take away the cost savings
    because you can't talk with three people simultaneously", he says.
    Robert LoCascio is the CEO of LivePerson, a company that developed
    and sells a chat tool that allows live operators to interact with
    Web shoppers in real time. Chat is considerably cheaper than than
    phone for sales and support. A phone call costs in average around
    $6.00, but the average chat is $2.40. Chat is cheaper because operators
    can chat with multiple customers and have pre-scripted responses.},

  abstract = {{Written by the three pioneers behind the Unified Modeling Language
    (UML) standard, <I>The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual</I>
    provides an excellent real-world guide to working with UML. This
    title provides expert knowledge on all facets of today's UML standard,
    helping developers who are encountering UML on the job for the first
    time to be more productive.<p> The book begins with a history of
    UML, from structured design methods of the '60s and '70s to the
    competing object-oriented design standards that were unified in
    1997 to create UML. For the novice, the authors illustrate key diagram
    types such as <I>class</I>, <I>use case</I>, <I>state machine</I>,
    <I>activity</I>, and <I>implementation</I>. (Of course, learning
    these basic diagram types is what UML is all about. The authors
    use an easy-to-understand ticket-booking system for many of their
    examples.)<p> After a tour of basic document types, <I>The Unified
    Modeling Language Reference Manual</I> provides an alphabetical
    listing of more than 350 UML terms. Entries range from a sentence
    or two to several pages in length. (<I>Class</I>, <I>operation</I>,
    and <I>use case</I> are just a few of the important terms that are
    covered.) Though you will certainly need to be acquainted with software
    engineering principles, this reference will serve the working software
    developer well. As the authors note, this isn't <I>UML for Dummies</I>,
    but neither is it an arcane academic treatise. The authors succeed
    in delivering a readable reference that will answer any UML question,
    no matter how common or obscure. <I>--Richard Dragan</I>} {The authors
    have done an outstanding job with this UML book. The definitions
    of the terms are the best I have seen. The organization and material
    in the encyclopedia are fantastic!<BR> -Perry Cole, MCIWorldCom
    <p>The Unified Modeling Language (UML) has rapidly become the standard
    notation for modeling software-intensive systems. This book provides
    the definitive description of UML from its original developers--James
    Rumbaugh, Ivar Jacobson, and Grady Booch. Whether you are capturing
    requirements, developing a software architecture, designing the
    implementation, or trying to understand an existing system, this
    is the book for you. <BR> <br> The majority of the book is a unique
    alphabetical list of articles covering every aspect of UML in a
    form convenient for quick reference and detailed study. This format
    permits full coverage of UML details as well as high-level articles
    without confusing the reader by constant shifts in level. The first
    part of the book--a complete summary of UML concepts organized by
    subject area--provides an introduction to UML for the newcomer as
    well as entry points into the detailed articles. <BR> <br>Highlights
    of the book include: <BR> Two-color diagrams, extensively annotated
    <BR> Thorough coverage of both semantics and notation, separated
    in each article for easy reference <BR> Further explanations of
    concepts whose meaning or purpose is obscure in the original specifications
    <BR> Discussion sections offering usage advice and additional insight
    into tricky concepts <BR> A hyperlinked version of the book in Adobe
    Reader format on CD-ROM, an excellent resource for browsing or searching
    the text for specific information <BR> Full text of the UML specification
    documents on CD-ROM, courtesy of the Object Management Group <BR>

    abstract = {Murray discusses the unique properties and pleasures of digital environments and connects them with the tradition satisfactions of narrative. She analyzes the dramatic satisfaction of participatory stories and considers what would be necessary to move interactive fiction from the formats of childish games and confusing labyrinths into a mature and compelling art form. She also introduces the reader to landscapes populated by witty automated characters and tele-playing interactors, who together make up a new kind of commedia dell'arte. Through a blend of imagination and techno-wizardry, Murray provides both readers and writers with a guide to the storytelling of the future.
She analyzes the state of "immersion," of participating in a text to such an extent that you literally get lost in a story.},

In games the primary cognitive activity is not interpretation but configuration, the capacity to transform certain aspects of the virtual environment with potentially significant consequences for the system as a whole" (p. 60).},

@article{hemp2006,
      Abstract = {Advertising has always targeted a powerful consumer alter ego: that hip, attractive, incredibly popular person just waiting to emerge (with the help of the advertised product) from an all-too-normal self. Now, in cyberspace, consumers are taking the initiative and adopting alter egos that are anything but under wraps. These online personae, called avatars, range from simple but personalized cartoonlike characters used as pictorial signatures in instant messaging to fully developed characters in virtual worlds. And they represent a huge population of "shadow" customers who can be analyzed, segmented, and targeted. The experience of living through another self is most powerful in so-called massively multiplayer online role-playing games, which enable thousands of people to interact simultaneously within the same three-dimensional virtual world. In such settings, participants effectively become the avatars they've created, looking out through their eyes and engaging with other such beings. In this article, which expands upon an item in "The HBR List: Breakthrough Ideas for 2006" (HBR February 2006), the author examines early efforts to market real-world products in virtual worlds. He argues that companies need to quickly look beyond the market itself and think about the potential customer, which may be the avatar rather than its creator. Of course, the human behind the avatar controls the money in the real-world wallet. But the avatar, as a distinct creation of the user's psyche, can influence its creator's purchasing behavior and even make its own purchases of real-world products in the virtual world, deliverable to the user's real-world door. At the least, avatars offer a window into people's hidden preferences and a means for achieving sustained consumer engagement with a brand. The marketing initiatives of the few pathfinding companies working in this area point toward some methods that might be used in the future.},

 @book{memes,
	abstract = {{In <I>The Selfish Gene</I>, Richard Dawkins proposed the concept of the <i>meme</i> as a unit of culture, spread by imitation. Now Dawkins himself says of Susan Blackmore: <p>  <blockquote> Showing greater courage and intellectual <I>chutzpah</I> than I have ever aspired to, she deploys her memetic forces in a brave--do not think foolhardy until you have read it--assault on the deepest questions of all: What is a self? What am I? Where am I? ... Any theory deserves to be given its best shot, and that is what Susan Blackmore has given the theory of the meme. </blockquote><p>  Blackmore is a parapsychologist who rejects the paranormal, a skeptical investigator of near-death experiences, and a practitioner of Zen. Her explanation of the science of the meme (memetics) is rigorously Darwinian. Because she is a careful thinker (though by no means dull or conventional), the reader ends up with a good idea of what memetics explains well and what it doesn't, and with many ideas about how it can be tested--the very hallmark of an excellent science book. Blackmore's discussion of the "memeplexes" of religion and of the self are sure to be controversial, but she is (as Dawkins says) enormously honest and brave to make a connection between scientific ideas and how one should live one's life. <I>--Mary Ellen Curtin</I> } { What is a meme? First coined by Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene, a meme is any idea, behavior, or skill that can be transferred from one person to another by imitation: stories, fashions, inventions, recipes, songs, ways of plowing a field or throwing a baseball or making a sculpture. The<br>meme is also one of the most important--and controversial--concepts to emerge since The Origin of the Species appeared nearly 150 years ago.<br>     In The Meme Machine Susan Blackmore boldly asserts: "Just as the design of our bodies can be understood only in terms of natural selection, so the design of our minds can be understood only in terms of memetic selection."  Indeed, Blackmore shows that once our distant ancestors acquired the<br>crucial ability to imitate, a second kind of natural selection began, a survival of the fittest amongst competing ideas and behaviors. Ideas and behaviors that proved most adaptive--making tools, for example, or using language--survived and flourished, replicating themselves in as many minds as<br>possible. These memes then passed themselves on from generation to generation by helping to ensure that the genes of those who acquired them also survived and reproduced. Applying this theory to many aspects of human life, Blackmore offers brilliant explanations for why we live in cities, why we<br>talk so much, why we can't stop thinking, why we behave altruistically, how we choose our mates, and much more.<br>    With controversial implications for our religious beliefs, our free will, our very sense of "self," The Meme Machine offers a provocative theory everyone will soon be talking about. }},

	abstract = {Despite tendencies toward convergence, differences between individuals and groups continue to exist in beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. An agent-based adaptive model reveals the effects of a mechanism of convergent social influence. The actors are placed at fixed sites. The basic premise is that the more similar an actor is to a neighbor, the more likely that that actor will adopt one of the neighbor's traits. Unlike previous models of social influence or cultural change that treat features one at a time, the proposed model takes into account the interaction between different features. The model illustrates how local convergence can generate global polarization. Simulations show that the number of stable homogeneous regions decreases with the number of features, increases with the number of alternative traits per feature, decreases with the range of interaction, and (most surprisingly) decreases when the geographic territory grows beyond a certain size. 10.1177/0022002797041002001},

  abstract = {Information systems can serve as intermediaries between the buyers
    and the sellers in a vertical market, thus creating an {"}electronic
    market-place.{"} A major impact of these electronic market systems
    is that they typically reduce the search costs buyers must pay to
    obtain information about the prices and product offerings available
    in the market. Economic theory suggests that this reduction in search
    costs plays a major role in determining the implications of these
    systems for market efficiency and competitive behavior. This article
    draws on economic models of search and examines how prices, seller
    profits, and buyer welfare are affected by reducing search costs
    in commodity and differentiated markets. This reduction results
    in direct efficiency gains from reduced intermediation costs and
    in indirect but possibly larger gains in allocational efficiency
    from better-informed buyers. Because electronic market systems generally
    reduce buyers' search costs, they ultimately increase the efficiency
    of interorganizational transactions, in the process affecting the
    market power of buyers and sellers. The economic characteristics
    of electronic marketplaces, in addition to their ability to reduce
    search costs, create numerous possibilities for the strategic use
    of these systems.},

  month = {November},
  abstract = {{Kent Beck's <I>eXtreme Programming eXplained</I> provides an intriguing
    high-level overview of the author's Extreme Programming (XP) software
    development methodology. Written for IS managers, project leaders,
    or programmers, this guide provides a glimpse at the principles
    behind XP and its potential advantages for small- to mid-size software
    development teams.<p> The book intends to describe what XP is, its
    guiding principles, and how it works. Simply written, the book avoids
    case studies and concrete details in demonstrating the efficacy
    of XP. Instead, it demonstrates how XP relies on simplicity, unit
    testing, programming in pairs, communal ownership of code, and customer
    input on software to motivate code improvement during the development
    process. As the author notes, these principles are not new, but
    when they're combined their synergy fosters a new and arguably better
    way to build and maintain software. Throughout the book, the author
    presents and explains these principles, such as "rapid feedback"
    and "play to win," which form the basis of XP.<p> Generally speaking,
    XP changes the way programmers work. The book is good at delineating
    new roles for programmers and managers who Beck calls "coaches."
    The most striking characteristic of XP is that programmers work
    in pairs, and that testing is an intrinsic part of the coding process.
    In a later section, the author even shows where XP works and where
    it doesn't and offers suggestions for migrating teams and organizations
    over to the XP process. <p> In the afterword, the author recounts
    the experiences that led him to develop and refine XP, an insightful
    section that should inspire any organization to adopt XP. This book
    serves as a useful introduction to the philosophy and practice of
    XP for the manager or programmer who wants a potentially better
    way to build software. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>:
    Extreme Programming (XP) software methodology, principles, XP team
    roles, facilities design, testing, refactoring, the XP software
    lifecycle, and adopting XP.} {Software development projects can
    be fun, productive, and even daring. Yet they can consistently deliver
    value to a business and remain under control. <P>Extreme Programming
    (XP) was conceived and developed to address the specific needs of
    software development conducted by small teams in the face of vague
    and changing requirements. This new lightweight methodology challenges
    many conventional tenets, including the long-held assumption that
    the cost of changing a piece of software necessarily rises dramatically
    over the course of time. XP recognizes that projects have to work
    to achieve this reduction in cost and exploit the savings once they
    have been earned. <P>Fundamentals of XP include: <P>* Distinguishing
    between the decisions to be made by business interests and those
    to be made by project stakeholders. * Writing unit tests before
    programming and keeping all of the tests running at all times. *
    Integrating and testing the whole system-several times a day. *
    Producing all software in pairs, two programmers at one screen.
    * Starting projects with a simple design that constantly evolves
    to add needed flexibility and remove unneeded complexity. * Putting
    a minimal system into production quickly and growing it in whatever
    directions prove most valuable. <P>Why is XP so controversial? Some
    sacred cows don't make the cut in XP: <P>* Don't force team members
    to specialize and become analysts, architects, programmers, testers,
    and integrators-every XP programmer participates in all of these
    critical activities every day. * Don't conduct complete up-front
    analysis and design-an XP project starts with a quick analysis of
    the entire system, and XP programmers continue to make analysis
    and design decisions throughout development. * Develop infrastructure
    and frameworks as you develop your application, not up-front-delivering
    business value is the heartbeat that drives XP projects. * Don't
    write and maintain implementation documentation-communication in
    XP projects occurs face-to-face, or through efficient tests and
    carefully written code. <P>You may love XP or you may hate it, but
    Extreme Programming Explained will force you to take a fresh look
    at how you develop software.}},

    because you can't talk with three people simultaneously", he says.
    Robert LoCascio is the CEO of LivePerson, a company that developed
    and sells a chat tool that allows live operators to interact with
    Web shoppers in real time. Chat is considerably cheaper than than
    phone for sales and support. A phone call costs in average around
    $6.00, but the average chat is $2.40. Chat is cheaper because operators
    can chat with multiple customers and have pre-scripted responses.},

    (UML) standard, <I>The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual</I>
    provides an excellent real-world guide to working with UML. This
    title provides expert knowledge on all facets of today's UML standard,
    helping developers who are encountering UML on the job for the first
    time to be more productive.<p> The book begins with a history of
    UML, from structured design methods of the '60s and '70s to the
    competing object-oriented design standards that were unified in
    1997 to create UML. For the novice, the authors illustrate key diagram
    types such as <I>class</I>, <I>use case</I>, <I>state machine</I>,
    <I>activity</I>, and <I>implementation</I>. (Of course, learning
    these basic diagram types is what UML is all about. The authors
    use an easy-to-understand ticket-booking system for many of their
    examples.)<p> After a tour of basic document types, <I>The Unified
    Modeling Language Reference Manual</I> provides an alphabetical
    listing of more than 350 UML terms. Entries range from a sentence
    or two to several pages in length. (<I>Class</I>, <I>operation</I>,
    and <I>use case</I> are just a few of the important terms that are
    covered.) Though you will certainly need to be acquainted with software
    engineering principles, this reference will serve the working software
    developer well. As the authors note, this isn't <I>UML for Dummies</I>,
    but neither is it an arcane academic treatise. The authors succeed
    in delivering a readable reference that will answer any UML question,
    no matter how common or obscure. <I>--Richard Dragan</I>} {The authors
    have done an outstanding job with this UML book. The definitions
    of the terms are the best I have seen. The organization and material
    in the encyclopedia are fantastic!<BR> -Perry Cole, MCIWorldCom
    <p>The Unified Modeling Language (UML) has rapidly become the standard
    notation for modeling software-intensive systems. This book provides
    the definitive description of UML from its original developers--James
    Rumbaugh, Ivar Jacobson, and Grady Booch. Whether you are capturing
    requirements, developing a software architecture, designing the
    implementation, or trying to understand an existing system, this
    is the book for you. <BR> <br> The majority of the book is a unique
    alphabetical list of articles covering every aspect of UML in a
    form convenient for quick reference and detailed study. This format
    permits full coverage of UML details as well as high-level articles
    without confusing the reader by constant shifts in level. The first
    part of the book--a complete summary of UML concepts organized by
    subject area--provides an introduction to UML for the newcomer as
    well as entry points into the detailed articles. <BR> <br>Highlights
    of the book include: <BR> Two-color diagrams, extensively annotated
    <BR> Thorough coverage of both semantics and notation, separated
    in each article for easy reference <BR> Further explanations of
    concepts whose meaning or purpose is obscure in the original specifications
    <BR> Discussion sections offering usage advice and additional insight
    into tricky concepts <BR> A hyperlinked version of the book in Adobe

She also introduces the reader to landscapes populated by witty automated characters and tele-playing interactors, who together make up a new kind of commedia dell'arte. Through a blend of imagination and techno-wizardry, Murray provides both readers and writers with a guide to the storytelling of the future.
She analyzes the state of "immersion," of participating in a text to such an extent that you literally get lost in a story.},

@article{hemp2006,
      Abstract = {Advertising has always targeted a powerful consumer alter ego: that hip, attractive, incredibly popular person just waiting to emerge (with the help of the advertised product) from an all-too-normal self. Now, in cyberspace, consumers are taking the initiative and adopting alter egos that are anything but under wraps. These online personae, called avatars, range from simple but personalized cartoonlike characters used as pictorial signatures in instant messaging to fully developed characters in virtual worlds. And they represent a huge population of "shadow" customers who can be analyzed, segmented, and targeted. The experience of living through another self is most powerful in so-called massively multiplayer online role-playing games, which enable thousands of people to interact simultaneously within the same three-dimensional virtual world. In such settings, participants effectively become the avatars they've created, looking out through their eyes and engaging with other such beings. In this article, which expands upon an item in "The HBR List: Breakthrough Ideas for 2006" (HBR February 2006), the author examines early efforts to market real-world products in virtual worlds. He argues that companies need to quickly look beyond the market itself and think about the potential customer, which may be the avatar rather than its creator. Of course, the human behind the avatar controls the money in the real-world wallet. But the avatar, as a distinct creation of the user's psyche, can influence its creator's purchasing behavior and even make its own purchases of real-world products in the virtual world, deliverable to the user's real-world door. At the least, avatars offer a window into people's hidden preferences and a means for achieving sustained consumer engagement with a brand. The marketing initiatives of the few pathfinding companies working in this area point toward some methods that might be used in the future.},

  @InProceedings{heritage_pompeii,
   abstract    = {Pompeii was a Roman city, destroyed and completely
                 buried during an eruption of the volcano Mount Vesuvius.
                 We have revived its past by creating a 3D model of its
                 previous appearance and populated it with crowds of
                 Virtual Romans. In this paper, we detail the process,
                 based on archaeological data, to simulate ancient Pompeii
                 life in real time. In a first step, an annotated city
                 model is generated using procedural modelling. These
                 annotations contain semantic data, such as land usage,
                 building age, and window/door labels. In a second phase,
                 the semantics are automatically interpreted to populate
                 the scene and trigger special behaviors in the crowd,
                 depending on the location of the characters. Finally, we
                 describe the system pipeline, which allows for the
                 simulation of thousands of Virtual Romans in real time.},

 @book{memes,
	abstract = {{In <I>The Selfish Gene</I>, Richard Dawkins proposed the concept of the <i>meme</i> as a unit of culture, spread by imitation. Now Dawkins himself says of Susan Blackmore: <p>  <blockquote> Showing greater courage and intellectual <I>chutzpah</I> than I have ever aspired to, she deploys her memetic forces in a brave--do not think foolhardy until you have read it--assault on the deepest questions of all: What is a self? What am I? Where am I? ... Any theory deserves to be given its best shot, and that is what Susan Blackmore has given the theory of the meme. </blockquote><p>  Blackmore is a parapsychologist who rejects the paranormal, a skeptical investigator of near-death experiences, and a practitioner of Zen. Her explanation of the science of the meme (memetics) is rigorously Darwinian. Because she is a careful thinker (though by no means dull or conventional), the reader ends up with a good idea of what memetics explains well and what it doesn't, and with many ideas about how it can be tested--the very hallmark of an excellent science book. Blackmore's discussion of the "memeplexes" of religion and of the self are sure to be controversial, but she is (as Dawkins says) enormously honest and brave to make a connection between scientific ideas and how one should live one's life. <I>--Mary Ellen Curtin</I> } { What is a meme? First coined by Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene, a meme is any idea, behavior, or skill that can be transferred from one person to another by imitation: stories, fashions, inventions, recipes, songs, ways of plowing a field or throwing a baseball or making a sculpture. The<br>meme is also one of the most important--and controversial--concepts to emerge since The Origin of the Species appeared nearly 150 years ago.<br>     In The Meme Machine Susan Blackmore boldly asserts: "Just as the design of our bodies can be understood only in terms of natural selection, so the design of our minds can be understood only in terms of memetic selection."  Indeed, Blackmore shows that once our distant ancestors acquired the<br>crucial ability to imitate, a second kind of natural selection began, a survival of the fittest amongst competing ideas and behaviors. Ideas and behaviors that proved most adaptive--making tools, for example, or using language--survived and flourished, replicating themselves in as many minds as<br>possible. These memes then passed themselves on from generation to generation by helping to ensure that the genes of those who acquired them also survived and reproduced. Applying this theory to many aspects of human life, Blackmore offers brilliant explanations for why we live in cities, why we<br>talk so much, why we can't stop thinking, why we behave altruistically, how we choose our mates, and much more.<br>    With controversial implications for our religious beliefs, our free will, our very sense of "self," The Meme Machine offers a provocative theory everyone will soon be talking about. }},

 @article{Axelrod,
	abstract = {Despite tendencies toward convergence, differences between individuals and groups continue to exist in beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. An agent-based adaptive model reveals the effects of a mechanism of convergent social influence. The actors are placed at fixed sites. The basic premise is that the more similar an actor is to a neighbor, the more likely that that actor will adopt one of the neighbor's traits. Unlike previous models of social influence or cultural change that treat features one at a time, the proposed model takes into account the interaction between different features. The model illustrates how local convergence can generate global polarization. Simulations show that the number of stable homogeneous regions decreases with the number of features, increases with the number of alternative traits per feature, decreases with the range of interaction, and (most surprisingly) decreases when the geographic territory grows beyond a certain size. 10.1177/0022002797041002001},

two other versions. In one of the other versions the shifts in gaze were kept minimal and in the other version the shifts would occur randomly. The talking face has a number of restrictions. There is no speech recognition, so questions and replies have to be typed in by the users
of the systems. Despite this restriction we found that participants that conversed with the agent that behaved according to the human-like patterns appreciated the agent better than participants that conversed with the other agents. Conversations with the optimal version also
proceeded more efficiently. Participants needed less time to complete their task.}

	in open multi-agent systems (MAS) are of high interest since we cannot
	employ centralized approaches relying on global knowledge. In actual-world
	societies, the balance between personal and social interests is self-regulated
	through social conventions that emerge in a decentralized manner.
	As such, a computational mechanism that allows to engineer the emergence
	of social conventions in MAS can become a highly promising tool to
	endow open MAS with self-regulating capabilities. To this end we
	propose a computational \emph{self-adapting} mechanism that facilitates
	agents to distributively evolve their social behavior to reach the
	best social conventions. Our approach borrows from the social contagion
	phenomenon: social conventions are akin to infectious diseases that
	spread themselves through members of the society. Furthermore, we
	experimentally show that our mechanism helps a MAS to regulate itself
	by searching and establishing (better) social conventions on a wide
	range of interaction topologies and dynamic environments.},

What are the professional, social, and political impacts of this new brain evolution? How must you adapt and at what price? While high-tech immersion can accelerate learning and boost creativity, it also has its glitches, among them the meteoric rise in ADD diagnoses, increased social isolation, and Internet addiction. To compete and thrive in the age of brain evolution, and to avoid these potential drawbacks, we must adapt, and iBrain--with its Technology Toolkit--equips us with tools and strategies needed to close the brain gap.--From publisher description.},

A large number of studies employed the OCC

Many developers of such characters believe that the OCC
model will be all they ever need to equip their character
with emotions. This paper points out what the OCC
model is able to do for an embodied emotional character
and what it does not. Missing features include a history
function, a personality designer and the interaction of the

  @article{OCEAN,
    abstract = {{In the 45 years since R. B. Cattell (1943, 1945) used English trait terms to begin the formulation of his "description of personality," a number of investigators have proposed an alternative structure based on 5 orthogonal factors. The generality of this 5-factor model is here demonstrated across unusually comprehensive sets of trait terms. In the 1st of 3 studies, 1,431 trait adjectives grouped into 75 clusters were analyzed; virtually identical structures emerged in 10 replications, each based on a different factor-analytic procedure. A 2nd study of 479 common terms grouped into 133 synonym clusters revealed the same structure in 2 samples of self-ratings and in 2 samples of peer ratings. None of the factors beyond the 5th generalized across the samples. In the 3rd study, analyses of 100 clusters derived from 339 trait terms suggest their potential utility as Big-Five markers in future studies.}},
